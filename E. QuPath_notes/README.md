## Notes on Using QuPath for GeoMx ROI Image Segmentation

QuPath offers an interactive and alternative approach to cell segmentation. However, there are a few important considerations when using QuPath for GeoMx ROI image segmentation:

Pixel Width and Height Adjustment

Pixel width and Pixel height must be adjusted to ensure accurate scaling and alignment with the ROI image.
For GeoMx ROI outputs, a pixel size of 0.40 Âµm is recommended.
Key Parameters in "Positive Cell Detection"

The Threshold in the Intensity parameters is the primary tuning parameter; a value of 15 was used in this study.
The Intensity threshold parameters for "Threshold 1+", "2+" should also be fine-tuned. Suggested values include 10/20/30 or 20/30/40.
Comparison with Cellpose

QuPath tends to detect fewer cells compared to Cellpose.
Cells near the ROI margins are more likely to be falsely classified as positive.
