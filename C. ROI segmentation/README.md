1. For single sample processing, please follow `StepC_CellSeg_single_sample.ipynb`

2. For multiple sample processing, please follow `StepC_CellSeg_segmenation_batch.py`

3. For cases where mask file is used to call positive cells, please follow `StepC_CellSeg_ss_mask_pos.ipynb`. This is very useful when the positive cells cannot be called easily based on RGB colors.
